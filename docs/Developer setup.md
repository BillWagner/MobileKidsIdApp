Developer Environment Setup
===========================

Requirements:
* IDE
  * Visual Studio 2017.7.3 or higher
  * Visual Studio for Mac
  * Visual Studio Code
* Xamarin Tools or the Cross-platform Mobile option for Visual Studio
* Windows 10 FCU or later (unless on Mac or Linux)

This solution relies on the Xamarin tools and SDK for iOS, Android, UWP, and other platforms. The Xamarin tools are free, and you must add them to your Visual Studio installation before you can work with the projects in this solution.

Other dependencies are pulled from NuGet, and that should automatically occur on first build.
